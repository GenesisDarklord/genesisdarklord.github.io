    <h2>About This Playground</h2>
    <p>
        I used the webpage <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/">w3schools</a> like a guide to learn for my own about HTML tags, how it works, the capabilities of each one an much more. It's very fun to learn this way so i created this playground page that contains all tests i did while learning. Enjoy my chaos 👍 :).
